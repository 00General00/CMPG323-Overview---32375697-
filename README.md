## Branching Strategy
Branching allows for more development features and develop independently. (https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)
Whenever a software development team wants to write, merge and/or place code (deploy) using version control systems, this strategy is called Branching. (https://www.flagship.io/git-branching-strategies/#:~:text=A%20branching%20strategy%2C%20therefore%2C%20is,interact%20with%20a%20shared%20codebase.)
within in each of my project, I will mainly be using 2 branches, the main branch and the Development branch. There will also be a hotfix branch.




## Use of .gitignore file
This file is created in the repository's root directory and thus tells Git the files and directories that must be ignored whenever one wants to commit.

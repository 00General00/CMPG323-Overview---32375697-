## Branching Strategy
Branching allows for more development features and develop independently (github docs).
Whenever a software development team wants to write, merge and/or place code (deploy) using version control systems, this strategy is called Branching (Hadda, R. 2022).
within in each of my project, there will be a main stratedy. I will mainly be using the main branch and the Development branch. There will also be a hotfix branch here and there, if necessary.




## Use of *.gitignore* file
This file is created in the repository's root directory and thus tells Git the files and directories that must be ignored whenever one wants to commit (GitHub Docs, 2022).
I will be ignoring previous versions of my applications, as a version control.
Each repository will have *.gitignore* file to ignore certain version of ode that are unwanted and also to send or commit ignore rules for those users that want to clone my Repositories.

## Credentials and Sensitive information
A database will be used to store such information, As they are able to store a large amount of information and thereafter even encrypt the information if seen neccessary (Just like this instant).
